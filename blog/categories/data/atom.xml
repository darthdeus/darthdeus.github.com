    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We talked about transactions in <a href="http://darthdeus.github.com/blog/2013/01/27/ember-data-in-depth/">one of the previous articles</a>
(read it if you haven't already), but we didn't really touch on when to
use them in real world. One of the most common use cases for me is when
I just want to manage a single record while there are many changes
happening on the page.</p>

<p>Adding a record to a transaction is simple</p>

<p>```javascript
// say that we are in a controller
store = this.get("store");</p>

<p>// this ALWAYS returns a new transaction
transaction = store.transaction();</p>

<p>user = App.User.find(1);
transaction.add(user);</p>

<p>transaction.toString(); // => "&lt;DS.Transaction:ember955>"
```</p>

<p>Now this is obvious, but what if we need to commit the transaction in a
completely different action? Do we need to store the instance somewhere
to use it later?</p>

<p>The answer is NO, we can always return the transaction in which the
record is by calling <code>.get("transaction")</code>. We can even do it if we
decide to fetch the user again in a completely different part of the
application.</p>

<p><code>javascript
user = App.User.find(1);
user.get("transaction").toString(); // =&gt; "&lt;DS.Transaction:ember955&gt;"
</code></p>

<p>It doesn't matter in which part of the application you add the record to
a transaction because you can always retrieve the correct instance
later.</p>

<p>Which allows us to do something like this:</p>

<p>```javascript
App.UsersNewRoute = Ember.Route.extend({
  model: function() {</p>

<pre><code>var transaction = this.get("store").transaction();

var user = transaction.createRecord(App.User, {});
return user;
</code></pre>

<p>  },</p>

<p>  events: {</p>

<pre><code>createUser: function(user) {
  user.get("transaction").commit();
}
</code></pre>

<p>  }
});
```</p>

<p>Personally I use this when I only care about one record, but I know that
there might be other which are <code>dirty</code> and I don't want to commit those.
This happens almost every time you have two forms displayed at once.</p>

    <id>http://darthdeus.github.com/blog/2013/01/31/how-to-find-a-model-by-any-attribute-in-ember-dot-js</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the common things people ask about Ember Data is how to find a
single record by it's attribute. This is because the current revision
(11) only offers three methods of fetching records</p>

<p><code>javascript
App.User.find(1) // returns a single user record
App.User.find({ username: "wycats" }) // returns a ManyArray
App.User.findQuery({ username: "wycats" }) // same as the above
</code></p>

<p>If you want to search for a user by his username, you have two options</p>

<h2>Using .find with <em>smart</em> server side</h2>

<p>The way <code>App.User.find(1)</code> works is that it does a request to
<code>/users/1</code>, which is expected to return just one record.</p>

<p>You could modify your server to accept both <code>username</code> and <code>id</code> on the
<code>/users/1</code> path, which would allow to do <code>App.User.find("wycats")</code>.</p>

<p>There's an issue with this though. If you load the same user via his
<code>username</code> and <code>id</code>, you'll end up with two records stored in the Ember
identity map.</p>

<p>Which basically means that if you try to retrieve all of the user
records, you will end up with that one user twice.</p>

<p>If you want to read more about this, <a href="https://github.com/emberjs/data/issues/571">checkout this GitHub
issue</a></p>

<h2>Using a findQuery</h2>

<p>This might not seem like the right solution at first, since it returns a
<code>DS.ManyArray</code> instead of just one record, but hang on.</p>

<p><code>DS.ManyArray</code> is a subclass of <code>DS.RecordArray</code>, which includes a
<code>DS.LoadPromise</code>.</p>

<p>To understand how <code>DS.LoadPromise</code> works, we need to understand what
promises are. <a href="https://gist.github.com/3889970">There's a great article about
that</a>, so I won't go into much detail.</p>

<p>Promise is basically an async monad (I guess that doesn't help, let's
try again).</p>

<p>Promise is something which allows you to return an object which wraps
around a value, even if you don't have the value yet. For example if
you're doing <code>App.User.findQuery</code>, you'll get back an empty
<code>DS.ManyArray</code> instantly.</p>

<p>It doesn't wait until the AJAX request is finished, it just returns the
empty array, which is populated with the data once the request finishes.</p>

<p>This works because Ember uses data bindings and will automagically
update all of the views once the data is loaded. And also because the
router will wait if it's model has a state <code>isLoading</code>. That way you
won't display a page which is half loaded.</p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<p>Now that we know we're getting a <code>DS.ManyArray</code>, we need to figure out a
way to make it represent only the value of it's first element, because
that's what we care about.</p>

<p>```javascript
var users = App.User.findQuery({ username: username });</p>

<p>users.one("didLoad", function() {
  users.resolve(users.get("firstObject"));
});</p>

<p>return users;
```</p>

<p>You can see that we are returning the result of the <code>findQuery</code>
instantly, but we're also setting an asynchronous callback which
<strong>resolves the promise</strong> to the <code>firstObject</code> once it is loaded.</p>

<p>Another way you could read the <code>resolve(x)</code> is <em>from now you're
representing value <code>x</code></em>. Using this technique will work in all Ember,
because the data bindings will take care of everything. Always remember
that you don't need to worry about re-rendering your views, just change
the data and Ember will take care of the rest.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Ember Data in Depth]]></title>
    <link href="http://darthdeus.github.com/blog/2013/01/27/ember-data-in-depth/"/>
    <updated>2013-01-27T13:52:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://darthdeus.github.com/blog/2013/01/27/ember-data-in-depth</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a guide explaining how Ember Data works internaly. My initial
motivation for writing this is to understand Ember better myself. I've
found that every time I understand something about how Ember works, it
improves my application code.</p>

<h2>Main parts</h2>

<p>First we need to understand what are the main concepts. Let's start with
a simple example.</p>

<p><code>javascript
App.User = DS.Model.extend({
  username: DS.attr("string")
});
</code></p>

<p>Let's dive deep into this. There are four important concepts, two of
which are basic Ember.js and we're going to skip them</p>

<ul>
<li><code>App.User</code> represents a <code>User</code> class in the <code>App</code> namespace</li>
<li><code>username</code> represents a property on the <code>User</code> class</li>
</ul>


<p>These are the basics and you should be familiar with them to understand
the rest of this guide. Next we have <code>DS.Model</code> and <code>DS.attr</code>:</p>

<h2>DS.Model and DS.attr</h2>

<p><code>DS.Model</code> is one of the core concepts in Ember Data and it represents a
single <em>resource</em>. Models can have relationships with other models,
similar to how you'd model your data in a relational database. But let's
ignore that for now.</p>

<p><code>DS.Model</code> is both a state machine and a promise. If you don't
understand what promises are, please take a look at <a href="https://gist.github.com/3889970">this awesome
article</a> which explains them in depth.</p>

<p>State machines are used throughout Ember and they basically represent something <em>which can have multiple states and can transition between the states</em>. For example <code>DS.Model</code> can have the following states (<em><a href="http://emberjs.com/guides/models/model-lifecycle/">taken from the official Ember guide</a></em>):</p>

<ul>
<li><code>isLoaded</code> - The adapter has finished retrieving the current state of the record from its backend.</li>
<li><code>isDirty</code> - The record has local changes that have not yet been saved by the adapter. This includes records that have been created (but not yet saved) or deleted.</li>
<li><code>isSaving</code> - The record has been sent to the adapter to have its changes saved to the backend, but the adapter has not yet confirmed that the changes were successful.</li>
<li><code>isDeleted</code> - The record was marked for deletion. When <code>isDeleted</code> is true and <code>isDirty</code> is <code>true</code>, the record is deleted locally but the deletion was not yet persisted. When <code>isSaving</code> is true, the change is in-flight. When both <code>isDirty</code> and <code>isSaving</code> are <code>false</code>, the change has been saved.</li>
<li><code>isError</code> - The adapter reported that it was unable to save local changes to the backend. This may also result in the record having its <code>isValid</code> property become false if the adapter reported that server-side validations failed.</li>
<li><code>isNew</code> - The record was created locally and the adapter did not yet report that it was successfully saved.
<code>isValid</code> No client-side validations have failed and the adapter did not report any server-side validation failures.</li>
</ul>


<p>We can also bind to these with event handlers, which will be explained later, but for now let's just list them:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>didLoad</code></li>
<li><code>didCreate</code></li>
<li><code>didUpdate</code></li>
<li><code>didDelete</code></li>
<li><code>becameError</code></li>
<li><code>becameInvalid</code></li>
</ul>


<p><em><a href="https://github.com/emberjs/data/blob/f274153754cb8b629cd98fc6c590f18bc8ee3ff6/packages/ember-data/lib/system/model/states.js#L223-L245">I would also encourage you to go take a look at the source documentation on GitHub</a></em></p>

<p>It is important for us to understand what each state means, because they
can affect how our application behaves. For example if we try to modify
a record which is already being saved, we will get an exception saying
something like this</p>

<p><code>
Attempted to handle event `willSetProperty` on &lt;App.User:ember1144:null&gt;
while in state rootState.loaded.created.inFlight. Called with
{reference: [object Object], store: &lt;App.Store:ember313&gt;, name: username}
</code></p>

<p>The important part here is the <code>rootState.loaded.created.inFlight</code>. If
we look at <a href="https://github.com/emberjs/data/blob/f274153754cb8b629cd98fc6c590f18bc8ee3ff6/packages/ember-data/lib/system/model/states.js#L254-L261">the source of <code>DirtyState</code></a>, we can see what this means</p>

<blockquote><p>Dirty states have three child states:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>uncommitted</code>: the store has not yet handed off the record to be saved.</li>
<li><code>inFlight</code>: the store has handed off the record to be saved, but the adapter has not yet acknowledged success.</li>
<li><code>invalid</code>: the record has invalid information and cannot be send to the adapter yet.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Let's go through the record lifecycle and observe it's state. We can do
this by doing <code>.get("stateManager.currentState.name")</code></p>

<p>```javascript
user = App.User.find(1)
user.get("isLoaded") // => true
user.get("isDirty") // => false
user.get("stateManager.currentState.name") // => loaded</p>

<p>user.set("username", "wycats")
user.get("isLoaded") // => true
user.get("isDirty") // => true, which means comitting the transaction will save the record
user.get("stateManager.currentState.name") // => uncommitted</p>

<p>user.get("transaction").commit()
// while the record is being saved
user.get("stateManager.currentState.name") // => inFlight
user.get("isSaving") // => true
// after the record was saved
user.get("stateManager.currentState.name") // => saved
```</p>

<h2>Transactions and <code>commit()</code></h2>

<p>In the previous example, we've used <code>get("transaction").commit()</code> to
persist the changes to the server. <code>.commit()</code> will take all <code>dirty</code>
records in the transaction and persiste them to the server.</p>

<p>A record becomes dirty whenever one of it's attributes change. For
example</p>

<p><code>javascript
user = App.User.find(1)
user.get("isDirty") // =&gt; false
user.set("username", "wycats")
user.get("isDirty") // =&gt; true
</code></p>

<p>If we create a new record, it will be dirty by default</p>

<p><code>javascript
user = App.User.createRecord()
user.get("isDirty") // =&gt; true
</code></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/emberjs/data/pull/646">Currently there's a regression</a>
that we change an attribute to something else, and then back to the
original value, the record will be marked as dirty.</p>

<p>```javascript
user = App.User.find(1)
originalUsername = user.get("username")</p>

<p>user.get("isDirty") // => false
user.set("username", "wycats")
user.get("isDirty") // => true
user.set("username", originalUsername)
user.get("isDirty") // => true, even though it should be false
```</p>

<p>But let's hope this will be fixed soon.</p>

<h2>Transactions</h2>

<p>Until now we assumed that there is some <em>global</em> transaction which is
the same for every single model. But this doesn't have to be true. We
can create our own transactions and manage them at our will.</p>

<p>I recommend you take a look at <a href="https://github.com/emberjs/data/blob/master/packages/ember-data/tests/integration/transactions/basic_test.js">the tests for transactions in Ember Data
repository</a>.
They basically show all of the scenarios which you can encounter. For
example</p>

<p>```javascript
transaction = store.transaction();
record = transaction.createRecord(App.User, {});</p>

<p>transaction.commit(); // this will save the record to the server</p>

<p>record.set("foo", "bar");
transaction.commit(); // nothing is committed here, because the record</p>

<pre><code>                  // is removed from the transaction when it is saved
</code></pre>

<p>store.commit(); // this will save the record properly
```</p>

<p>We can also add a record to a transaction, which will remove it from the
global transaction. Important thing to note here is that
<a href="https://github.com/emberjs/data/blob/master/packages/ember-data/lib/system/store.js#L127-L129"><code>store.transaction()</code></a>
<strong>always returns a new transaction</strong>.</p>

<p>```javascript
user = App.User.find(1);
transaction = store.transaction();
transaction.add(user);</p>

<p>user.set("username", "wycats");</p>

<p>store.commit(); // nothing happens
transaction.commit(); // user is saved
```</p>

<p>Same goes for deleting records</p>

<p>```javascript
user = App.User.find(1);
transaction = store.transaction();
transaction.add(user);</p>

<p>user.deleteRecord();</p>

<p>store.commit(); // nothing happens
transaction.commit(); // user is deleted
```</p>

<p>We can also remove a record from a transaction</p>

<p>```javascript
user = App.User.find(1);
transaction = store.transaction();</p>

<p>transaction.add(user);
transaction.remove(user);</p>

<p>user.set("name", "wycats");</p>

<p>transaction.commit(); // nothing happens
```</p>

<p>One scenario when transactions can be useful is when you just need to
change one record, without affecting changes to other records. You can
put that change in a separate transaction, instead of just doing
<code>store.commit()</code>.</p>

<p>Important thing to note here is that there's a <code>defaultTransaction</code> for
the store to which you can get via <code>store.get("defaultTransaction")</code>.
This is where all of the records are placed, unless you explicitly
create a new transaction and assign a record to it.</p>

<p>These two are completely equivalent</p>

<p><code>javascript
store.commit();
store.get("defaultTransaction").commit();
</code></p>

<p>Just take a look at how <code>store.commit()</code> is defined</p>

<p><code>javascript
commit: function() {
  get(this, 'defaultTransaction').commit();
},
</code></p>

<h2><code>commit()</code></h2>

<p>Now that we understand how transactions work, let's dig deep into
<code>store.commit()</code>. First thing we need to understand here is that Ember
Transactions use this thing called <code>bucket</code> to store records with
various states in. This is first initialized in the <a href="https://github.com/emberjs/data/blob/master/packages/ember-data/lib/system/transaction.js#L91-L101"><code>init</code> method of
<code>DS.Transaction</code></a></p>

<p>```javascript
init: function() {
  set(this, 'buckets', {</p>

<pre><code>clean:    Ember.OrderedSet.create(),
created:  Ember.OrderedSet.create(),
updated:  Ember.OrderedSet.create(),
deleted:  Ember.OrderedSet.create(),
inflight: Ember.OrderedSet.create()
</code></pre>

<p>  });</p>

<p>  set(this, 'relationships', Ember.OrderedSet.create());
}
```</p>

<p>Each bucket represents one state in which a record can possibly be.
These are used in many different places in the transaction, and every
time a method changes it's state, it will be moved to a corresponding
bucket</p>

<p><code>javascript Example of recordBecameDirty
recordBecameDirty: function(bucketType, record) {
  this.removeFromBucket('clean', record);
  this.addToBucket(bucketType, record);
},
</code></p>
