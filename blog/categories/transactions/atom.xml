    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We talked about transactions in <a href="http://darthdeus.github.com/blog/2013/01/27/ember-data-in-depth/">one of the previous articles</a>
(read it if you haven't already), but we didn't really touch on when to
use them in real world. One of the most common use cases for me is when
I just want to manage a single record while there are many changes
happening on the page.</p>

<p>Adding a record to a transaction is simple</p>

<p>```javascript
// say that we are in a controller
store = this.get("store");</p>

<p>// this ALWAYS returns a new transaction
transaction = store.transaction();</p>

<p>user = App.User.find(1);
transaction.add(user);</p>

<p>transaction.toString(); // => "&lt;DS.Transaction:ember955>"
```</p>

<p>Now this is obvious, but what if we need to commit the transaction in a
completely different action? Do we need to store the instance somewhere
to use it later?</p>

<p>The answer is NO, we can always return the transaction in which the
record is by calling <code>.get("transaction")</code>. We can even do it if we
decide to fetch the user again in a completely different part of the
application.</p>

<p><code>javascript
user = App.User.find(1);
user.get("transaction").toString(); // =&gt; "&lt;DS.Transaction:ember955&gt;"
</code></p>

<p>It doesn't matter in which part of the application you add the record to
a transaction because you can always retrieve the correct instance
later.</p>

<p>Which allows us to do something like this:</p>

<p>```javascript
App.UsersNewRoute = Ember.Route.extend({
  model: function() {</p>

<pre><code>var transaction = this.get("store").transaction();

var user = transaction.createRecord(App.User, {});
return user;
</code></pre>

<p>  },</p>

<p>  events: {</p>

<pre><code>createUser: function(user) {
  user.get("transaction").commit();
}
</code></pre>

<p>  }
});
```</p>

<p>Personally I use this when I only care about one record, but I know that
there might be other which are <code>dirty</code> and I don't want to commit those.
This happens almost every time you have two forms displayed at once.</p>
